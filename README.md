# The Periodic Table of Elements

Made with CSS Grid, React and Science!

## How it was made?

I made the layout using CSS grid. The table is a bunch of boxes in 18 columns, arranged in a funny way.

I created each box with a <div> with a class of `element` and number like: `element-1`

I used emmet to auto populate 118 boxes.

After I arranged the elements the way it is, I then transitioned over React.

React allowed me to make the items interactive. I found a handy JSON that had all the element info which I used to dynamically populate the symbol names and other information. This saved me a lot of time and error making this table.
